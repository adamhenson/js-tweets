# About

Foo is in its early stages of being formulated. It will provide apps, integrations and subscription based web tools. [The roadmap](../business-plan/Roadmap.md) captures a plan of product rollouts.

I'm Adam Henson - the sole founder of Foo and author of this documentation. I'm an NYC based software engineer.
