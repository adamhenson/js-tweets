# Motivation

I've observed a variety of patterns, pitfalls, and challenges from my experiences delivering software. Many teams utilize a flavor of an Agile methodology in tandem with a delivery model to align efforts between software managers, desiners, engineers, product managers, and other team members. With this process established in an organization - the expectations are high.


### The Problem

With the fast and furious project delivery expectations - we rely on automation, defined by an array of tools, to help satisfy business needs. Problems can arise as an outcome of tools; how they're used, limitations, and / or implementation.

"Tech debt" snowballs in organizations, as visibility to these problems become clearer. The main source of motivation for me revolves around the number of times I've thought "there has to be a better way".
